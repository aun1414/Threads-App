## Overview
A clone of the "Threads" app was successfully developed, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance its capabilities. The project utilized Next.js for efficient server-side rendering, MongoDB for handling complex schemas and data population, and TailwindCSS for a polished user interface. Secure authentication was implemented through Clerk, while file uploads were seamlessly managed with UploadThing. Real-time event handling via webhooks was integrated for a dynamic user experience. TypeScript was employed for strong typing, Zod for data validation, and react hook form for effective form management, ensuring a well-structured and feature-rich application.
